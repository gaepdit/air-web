# Air Web Application History

## IAIP

The [Integrated Air Information Platform](https://github.com/gaepdit/iaip) was built beginning in 2004 to manage data
for the Air Protection Branch.

## Small Business Environmental Assistance Program

IAIP tools for the [SBEAP](https://github.com/gaepdit/sbeap) were moved to a separate
application [on 5-Sep-2023](https://github.com/gaepdit/sbeap/releases/tag/prod%2F2023.9.5).

## Air Web Application — Stationary Source Compliance Program

Planning for a new web application to continue migrating functionality out of the IAIP began in January 2024, starting
with SSCP compliance and enforcement activities.
